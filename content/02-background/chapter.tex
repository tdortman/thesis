\chapter{Background and Related Work}
\label{sec:background}

Having established the motivation for designing a GPU-accelerated Cuckoo filter, this chapter provides the necessary background information from its two relevant domains: probabilistic data structures and parallel computing. The discussion first traces the algorithmic lineage of the Cuckoo filter, beginning with the Bloom filter, progressing to the Cuckoo hashing scheme, and culminating in the Cuckoo filter itself. Subsequently, the focus shifts to hardware and software with an introduction to the GPU architecture, the CUDA programming model, and the key performance considerations essential for developing efficient parallel algorithms. A firm grasp of both these areas is crucial for understanding the design choices and implementation challenges addressed in the remainder of this thesis.
