\chapter{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

This chapter details the design and implementation of the high-performance GPU Cuckoo filter library.
It documents the parallel algorithms developed for insertion, lookup, and deletion, explaining how lock-free atomic operations are utilized to manage parallel accesses.
Furthermore, it describes advanced optimization techniques, including sorted insertion, alternative eviction strategies, and flexible bucket placement policies.
It also presents system-level extensions, including an Inter-Process Communication wrapper and a multi-GPU sharding mechanism.
Finally, the chapter outlines the comprehensive testing and verification strategies employed to ensure the correctness of the implementation.
