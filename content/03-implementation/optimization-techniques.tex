\section{Optimization Techniques}
\label{sec:implementation:optimisation-techniques}

Beyond the core algorithm design, some noteworthy optimization strategies were explored to further improve insertion performance, particularly in cases where the filter is too large to fit into the device's L2 cache or under high load factors.

\subsection{Sorted Insertion}
\label{sec:implementation:optimisation-techniques:sorted}

One version of the insertion algorithm was implemented to enhance memory locality. Before the main insertion kernel is launched, the items are first packed into a temporary structure where the upper bits represent the primary bucket index and the lower bits contain the fingerprint. This array is then sorted in parallel on the GPU using CUB's high-performance radix sort. Doing this ensures that consecutive threads in the subsequent insertion kernel are likely to be working on items that map to the same or nearby buckets. This approach led to a measurable performance increase once the filter size exceeded the GPU's L2 cache, as the random memory accesses of the standard approach were more heavily penalized. However, for filters that fit entirely within the L2 cache (which has a hit rate of over 90\% in these cases), the overhead of the initial packing and sorting pass made this version considerably slower and not worth using.

\subsection{Alternative Eviction Strategy}
\label{sec:implementation:optimisation-techniques:eviction}

The standard eviction process uses a greedy, depth-first-search (DFS) approach, where a thread immediately follows the eviction chain of a single evicted item. An alternative strategy was implemented to reduce the average length of these chains. When an eviction is necessary, instead of picking one random item to evict, the thread first inspects a configurable number of candidate fingerprints from the bucket (e.g., half the bucket size). For each candidate, it checks if its alternate bucket has an empty slot. If such a "safe" eviction is found, the swap is performed, and the insertion completes in a single step. If all candidates lead to full alternate buckets, the algorithm falls back to the original DFS-style greedy eviction. This method was found to have a negligible impact when inserting into an empty filter, but it provided a moderate speed-up of 15-20\% when inserting into a filter with a high load factor (e.g., 70\% or more), where long eviction chains are more common.
