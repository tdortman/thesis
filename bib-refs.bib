  abstract  = {In many networking systems, Bloom filters are used for high-speed set membership tests. They permit a small fraction of false positive answers with very good space efficiency. However, they do not permit deletion of items from the set, and previous attempts to extend "standard" Bloom filters to support deletion all degrade either space or performance.We propose a new data structure called the cuckoo filter that can replace Bloom filters for approximate set membership tests. Cuckoo filters support adding and removing items dynamically while achieving even higher performance than Bloom filters. For applications that store many items and target moderately low false positive rates, cuckoo filters have lower space overhead than space-optimized Bloom filters. Our experimental results also show that cuckoo filters outperform previous data structures that extend Bloom filters to support deletions substantially in both time and space.},

  abstract       = {As the global digitalization process continues, information is transformed into data and widely used, while the data are also at risk of serious privacy breaches. The Cuckoo filter is a data structure based on the Cuckoo hash. It encrypts data when it is used and can achieve privacy protection to a certain extent. The Cuckoo filter is an alternative to the Bloom filter, with advantages such as support for deleting elements and efficient space utilization. Cuckoo filters are widely used and developed in the fields of network engineering, storage systems, databases, file systems, distributed systems, etc., because they are often used to solve collection element query problems. In recent years, many variants of the Cuckoo filter have emerged based on ideas such as improving the structure and introducing new technologies in order to accommodate a variety of different scenarios, as well as a huge collection. With the development of the times, the improvement of the structure and operation logic of the Cuckoo filter itself has become an important direction for the research of aggregate element query.},
