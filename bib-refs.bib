  abstract       = {As the global digitalization process continues, information is transformed into data and widely used, while the data are also at risk of serious privacy breaches. The Cuckoo filter is a data structure based on the Cuckoo hash. It encrypts data when it is used and can achieve privacy protection to a certain extent. The Cuckoo filter is an alternative to the Bloom filter, with advantages such as support for deleting elements and efficient space utilization. Cuckoo filters are widely used and developed in the fields of network engineering, storage systems, databases, file systems, distributed systems, etc., because they are often used to solve collection element query problems. In recent years, many variants of the Cuckoo filter have emerged based on ideas such as improving the structure and introducing new technologies in order to accommodate a variety of different scenarios, as well as a huge collection. With the development of the times, the improvement of the structure and operation logic of the Cuckoo filter itself has become an important direction for the research of aggregate element query.},

  abstract  = {In many networking systems, Bloom filters are used for high-speed set membership tests. They permit a small fraction of false positive answers with very good space efficiency. However, they do not permit deletion of items from the set, and previous attempts to extend "standard" Bloom filters to support deletion all degrade either space or performance. We propose a new data structure called the cuckoo filter that can replace Bloom filters for approximate set membership tests. Cuckoo filters support adding and removing items dynamically while achieving even higher performance than Bloom filters. For applications that store many items and target moderately low false positive rates, cuckoo filters have lower space overhead than space-optimized Bloom filters. Our experimental results also show that cuckoo filters outperform previous data structures that extend Bloom filters to support deletions substantially in both time and space.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents new alternatives to the well-known Bloom filter data structure. The Bloom filter, a compact data structure supporting set insertion and membership queries, has found wide application in databases, storage systems, and networks. Because the Bloom filter performs frequent random reads and writes, it is used almost exclusively in RAM, limiting the size of the sets it can represent. This paper first describes the quotient filter, which supports the basic operations of the Bloom filter, achieving roughly comparable performance in terms of space and time, but with better data locality. Operations on the quotient filter require only a small number of contiguous accesses. The quotient filter has other advantages over the Bloom filter: it supports deletions, it can be dynamically resized, and two quotient filters can be efficiently merged.The paper then gives two data structures, the buffered quotient filter and the cascade filter, which exploit the quotient filter advantages and thus serve as SSD-optimized alternatives to the Bloom filter. The cascade filter has better asymptotic I/O performance than the buffered quotient filter, but the buffered quotient filter outperforms the cascade filter on small to medium data sets. Both data structures significantly outperform recently-proposed SSD-optimized Bloom filter variants, such as the elevator Bloom filter, buffered Bloom filter, and forest-structured Bloom filter. In experiments, the cascade filter and buffered quotient filter performed insertions 8.6--11 times faster than the fastest Bloom filter variant and performed lookups 0.94--2.56 times faster.},

  abstract  = {This paper deals with hash tables in which conflicts are resolved by open addressing. The initial contribution is a very simple insertion procedure which (in comparison to the standard approach) has the effect of dramatically reducing the variance of the number of probes required for a search. This leads to a new search procedure which requires only a constant number of probes, on average, even for full tables. Finally, an extension to these methods yields a new, simple way of performing deletions and subsequent insertions. Experimental results strongly indicate little degeneration in search time. In particular deletions and successful searches appear to require constant time (< 2.57 probes) and insertions and unsuccessful searches, O(logn).},

  abstract  = {Filters approximately store a set of items while trading off accuracy for space-efficiency and can address the limited memory on accelerators, such as GPUs. However, there is a lack of high-performance and feature-rich GPU filters as most advancements in filter research has focused on CPUs. In this paper, we explore the design space of filters with a goal to develop massively parallel, high performance, and feature rich filters for GPUs. We evaluate various filter designs in terms of performance, usability, and supported features and identify two filter designs that offer the right trade off in terms of performance, features, and usability. We present two new GPU-based filters, the TCF and GQF, that can be employed in various high performance data analytics applications. The TCF is a set membership filter and supports faster inserts and queries, whereas the GQF supports counting which comes at an additional performance cost. Both the GQF and TCF provide point and bulk insertion API and are designed to exploit the massive parallelism in the GPU without sacrificing usability and necessary features. The TCF and GQF are up to 4.4\texttimes{} and 1.4\texttimes{} faster than the previous GPU filters in our benchmarks and at the same time overcome the fundamental constraints in performance and usability in current GPU filters.},
