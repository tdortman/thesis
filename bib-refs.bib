  abstract       = {As the global digitalization process continues, information is transformed into data and widely used, while the data are also at risk of serious privacy breaches. The Cuckoo filter is a data structure based on the Cuckoo hash. It encrypts data when it is used and can achieve privacy protection to a certain extent. The Cuckoo filter is an alternative to the Bloom filter, with advantages such as support for deleting elements and efficient space utilization. Cuckoo filters are widely used and developed in the fields of network engineering, storage systems, databases, file systems, distributed systems, etc., because they are often used to solve collection element query problems. In recent years, many variants of the Cuckoo filter have emerged based on ideas such as improving the structure and introducing new technologies in order to accommodate a variety of different scenarios, as well as a huge collection. With the development of the times, the improvement of the structure and operation logic of the Cuckoo filter itself has become an important direction for the research of aggregate element query.},

  abstract  = {Nowadays, a growing number of servers and workstations feature an increasing number of GPUs. However, slow communication among GPUs can lead to poor application performance. Thus, there is a latent demand for efficient multi-GPU communication primitives on such systems. This paper focuses on the gather, scatter and all-to-all collectives, which are important operations for various algorithms including parallel sorting and distributed hashing. We present two distinct communication strategies (ring-based and flow-oriented) to generate transfer plans for their topology-aware implementation on NVLink-connected multi-GPU systems. We achieve a throughput of up to 526 GB/s for all-to-all and 148 GB/s for scatter/gather on a DGX-1 server with only a small memory overhead. Furthermore, we propose a cost-neutral alternative to the DGX-1 Volta topology that provides an expected higher throughput for the all-to-all collective while preserving the throughput in case of scatter/gather.

  abstract   = {In this paper trade-offs among certain computational factors in hash coding are analyzed. The paradigm problem considered is that of testing a series of messages one-by-one for membership in a given set of messages. Two new hash-coding methods are examined and compared with a particular conventional hash-coding method. The computational factors considered are the size of the hash area (space), the time required to identify a message as a nonmember of the given set (reject time), and an allowable error frequency.The new methods are intended to reduce the amount of space required to contain the hash-coded information from that associated with conventional methods. The reduction in space is accomplished by exploiting the possibility that a small fraction of errors of commission may be tolerable in some applications, in particular, applications in which a large amount of data is involved and a core resident hash area is consequently not feasible using conventional methods.In such applications, it is envisaged that overall performance could be improved by using a smaller core resident hash area in conjunction with the new methods and, when necessary, by using some secondary and perhaps time-consuming test to “catch” the small fraction of errors associated with the new methods. An example is discussed which illustrates possible areas of application for the new methods.Analysis of the paradigm problem demonstrates that allowing a small number of test messages to be falsely identified as members of the given set will permit a much smaller hash area to be used without increasing reject time.},

However, they do not permit deletion of items from the set, and previous attempts to extend "standard" Bloom filters to support deletion all degrade either space or performance. We propose a new data structure called the cuckoo filter that can replace Bloom filters for approximate set membership tests. Cuckoo filters support adding and removing items dynamically while achieving even higher performance than Bloom filters. For applications that store many items and target moderately low false positive rates, cuckoo filters have lower space overhead than space-optimized Bloom filters. Our experimental results also show that cuckoo filters outperform previous data structures that extend Bloom filters to support deletions substantially in both time and space.},

  abstract   = {This paper presents new alternatives to the well-known Bloom filter data structure. The Bloom filter, a compact data structure supporting set insertion and membership queries, has found wide application in databases, storage systems, and networks. Because the Bloom filter performs frequent random reads and writes, it is used almost exclusively in RAM, limiting the size of the sets it can represent. This paper first describes the quotient filter, which supports the basic operations of the Bloom filter, achieving roughly comparable performance in terms of space and time, but with better data locality. Operations on the quotient filter require only a small number of contiguous accesses. The quotient filter has other advantages over the Bloom filter: it supports deletions, it can be dynamically resized, and two quotient filters can be efficiently merged.The paper then gives two data structures, the buffered quotient filter and the cascade filter, which exploit the quotient filter advantages and thus serve as SSD-optimized alternatives to the Bloom filter. The cascade filter has better asymptotic I/O performance than the buffered quotient filter, but the buffered quotient filter outperforms the cascade filter on small to medium data sets. Both data structures significantly outperform recently-proposed SSD-optimized Bloom filter variants, such as the elevator Bloom filter, buffered Bloom filter, and forest-structured Bloom filter. In experiments, the cascade filter and buffered quotient filter performed insertions 8.6--11 times faster than the fastest Bloom filter variant and performed lookups 0.94--2.56 times faster.},

The initial contribution is a very simple insertion procedure which (in comparison to the standard approach) has the effect of dramatically reducing the variance of the number of probes required for a search. This leads to a new search procedure which requires only a constant number of probes, on average, even for full tables. Finally, an extension to these methods yields a new, simple way of performing deletions and subsequent insertions. Experimental results strongly indicate little degeneration in search time. In particular deletions and successful searches appear to require constant time (< 2.57 probes) and insertions and unsuccessful searches, O(logn).},

  abstract = {Since its initial release in 2000, the human reference genome has covered only the euchromatic fraction of the genome, leaving important heterochromatic regions unfinished. Addressing the remaining 8\% of the genome, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) Consortium presents a complete 3.055 billion–base pair sequence of a human genome, T2T-CHM13, that includes gapless assemblies for all chromosomes except Y, corrects errors in the prior references, and introduces nearly 200 million base pairs of sequence containing 1956 gene predictions, 99 of which are predicted to be protein coding. The completed regions include all centromeric satellite arrays, recent segmental duplications, and the short arms of all five acrocentric chromosomes, unlocking these complex regions of the genome to variational and functional studies.}

  abstract     = {The human Y chromosome has been notoriously difficult to sequence and assemble because of its complex repeat structure including long palindromes, tandem repeats, and segmental duplications1{\textendash}3. As a result, more than half of the Y chromosome is missing from the GRCh38 reference sequence and it remains the last human chromosome to be finished4, 5. Here, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium presents the complete 62,460,029 base pair sequence of a human Y chromosome from the HG002 genome (T2T-Y) that corrects multiple errors in GRCh38-Y and adds over 30 million base pairs of sequence to the reference, revealing the complete ampliconic structures of TSPY, DAZ, and RBMY gene families; 41 additional protein-coding genes, mostly from the TSPY family; and an alternating pattern of human satellite 1 and 3 blocks in the heterochromatic Yq12 region. We have combined T2T-Y with a prior assembly of the CHM13 genome4 and mapped available population variation, clinical variants, and functional genomics data to produce a complete and comprehensive reference sequence for all 24 human chromosomes.

  abstract  = {Filters approximately store a set of items while trading off accuracy for space-efficiency and can address the limited memory on accelerators, such as GPUs. However, there is a lack of high-performance and feature-rich GPU filters as most advancements in filter research has focused on CPUs. In this paper, we explore the design space of filters with a goal to develop massively parallel, high performance, and feature rich filters for GPUs. We evaluate various filter designs in terms of performance, usability, and supported features and identify two filter designs that offer the right trade off in terms of performance, features, and usability. We present two new GPU-based filters, the TCF and GQF, that can be employed in various high performance data analytics applications. The TCF is a set membership filter and supports faster inserts and queries, whereas the GQF supports counting which comes at an additional performance cost. Both the GQF and TCF provide point and bulk insertion API and are designed to exploit the massive parallelism in the GPU without sacrificing usability and necessary features. The TCF and GQF are up to 4.4\texttimes{} and 1.4\texttimes{} faster than the previous GPU filters in our benchmarks and at the same time overcome the fundamental constraints in performance and usability in current GPU filters.},
